# Project1_Exploring_Weather_Trends

## Summary

In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. I created a visualization and prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live which is Riyadh.
